## Welcome to my Mandatory I project.

### Why?
The purpose of this project is to document parts of the curriculum, deemed relevant in the preparation for the upcoming exams.

### How?
This includes, as explained in the prompt, code blocks and snippets, which all should seek to enhance the ways in which learning is able to take place.

The site is easily navigated, but for the few, needing some assistance in this regard, you shall henceforth be giveth an explanation:

In the navbar (the horizontal component in the top-part of your screen), the following subjects, can be explored.

1. js-basics
2. web-architecture
3. node-and-packages
4. security-and-performance

Now I will not delve into each of these here, but rather, I will explain the general structure of the site.

If an element is selected, a sidebar will appear, containing the sub-elements of the selected element. If you select a sub-element, the content of the sub-element will be displayed in the main content area.

### Additional information
If one should stumble upon an article, which at the surface level, should seem incomplete, this is all part of the design.
The article isn't actually incomplete, but the option of scrolling down, has for design purposes, been hidden, which doesn't make it obvious that there is more content to be found.
