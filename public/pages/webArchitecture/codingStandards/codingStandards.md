# Coding Standards
Although not specific to the architecture of web development, a goal of upholding universally accepted standards across languages, as well as keeping the code clean, will for various reasons make the life of the developers involved much easier.

1. Whether a code formatter is a good idea or not, a team should maintain the same formatting across the board.
* If not all are using it, it's doesn't help. Perhaps, quite the opposite.
2. The naming of functions and variables in the codebase, should be meaningful and descriptive, so as to decrease the need for comments throughout the program.
* Methods: camelCase
* Classes: PascalCase
3. Responsibilities should be separated across numerous modules, leaving no doubt, as to the specific purpose.
4. Not repeating thine-self, as repetitious code indicates that there might be room for optimization, removing redundancy.
