<h1>What is the assignment?</h1>

<p>
Create a website that contains the documentation for what you have learned so far

It is important to have the core of everything we've learned so far, but potentially, additionally, I could include
another in-depth topic (like GIT branching technologies).


Important note:
Within the formulation of the assignment, the way in which it is solved, is actually not specified in any meaningful
way.


Styling:
Will be our own responsibility to master.
There are some tasks (not to be handed in), where one can train some css concepts (like flex and grid).


Things to check up on:
Server Side Rendering (SSR).</p>
